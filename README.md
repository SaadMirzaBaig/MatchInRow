# MatchInRow

Welcome to the Match 3 in a row wiki!


## **Softwares used:**

* Unity3D version 2020.3.3f1
* Visual Studio

## **Game mechanics**
The game mechanics are as follows:

* The game consists of m x n tiles (configurable in editor or code).

* If three or more of the same tile type are in a horizontal row, the game removes them.

* A tile falls down if there is no tile below it (unless it's on the bottom row).

* The user can click on a tile. The game then removes the tile.

* When the game starts, all the positions should be filled with tiles and nothing should fall down.
